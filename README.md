# BedrockCoordinates

Bedrock Coordinates is a simple mod for Fabric that displays your coordinates in the top left corner of your screen, just like in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

You can toggle the visibility with F1, or disable it in the Accessibility Settings menu.

There is also a custom keybind that lets you switch between the player XYZ position and the block position shown in the F3 debug menu. You can change this in the keybind settings.

### Requirements

Fabric API
Fabric API must be installed for the mod to work.
